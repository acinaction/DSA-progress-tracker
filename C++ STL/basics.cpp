using namespace std;
// C++ STL is divided into 4 major parts:
// 1. Containers
//    - Sequencial Containers: Vectos, Stack, Queue, Pair;
//    - Ordered Containers: Maps, Multimaps, Sets, Multisets;
//    - Unordered Containers: Unordered Maps, Unordered Sets;

//    Nested Containers:
//    - Vectors of vectors
//    - Maps of vectors
//    - Vectors of maps
//    - Sets of Pairs

// 2. Iterators
//    - Iterators are used to point to the memory addresses of STL containers.
//    - begin() and end() functions are used to get the first and last elements of the container.
//    - Continuity for Containers: The iterators of the containers are continuous.

// 3. Algorithms
//    - Algorithms are used to perform operations on the containers.
//    - Algorithms are defined in the <algorithm> header file.
//    - Algorithms are used to perform operations on the containers.

// 4. Functors
//    - Functors are classes that can be called as if they are functions.
